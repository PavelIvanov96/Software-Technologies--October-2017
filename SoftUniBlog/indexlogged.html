                        <h2>Why choosing the Right Storage Infrastructure.</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        In our technology-driven world, it takes more than good ideas to be successful. Uber, for example, didn’t need to invent a new technology to build its business.
                        The company just took advantage of the explosion of smartphones and mobile applications to design a compelling customer experience and invent a new way of doing business.
                        But this isn’t just about Uber being able to execute a good idea. It’s also about the inability of the cab industry to act quickly to transform its own business models to compete.
                        Did they have time to respond to the market disruption that Uber represents?
                        Absolutely. But they needed an IT infrastructure that would allow them to pivot when the inevitable disruption arrived and they didn’t have that.
                        The lesson here is: Whether you are a Fortune 50 or 1000 company, everyone is at risk of missing a market opportunity, not securing their enterprise, and being disrupted by a new idea or business model.

                        <h2>What makes a computer fast and powerful?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        There are several components within a computer that help make it faster and more powerful. Below is a list of the main hardware components that help contribute to the performance of a computer.
                        Keep in mind that even the software running on the computer may impact the speed of a computer.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Processor (CPU)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    The overall speed or clock speed of the computer and how fast it is capable of processing data is managed by the computer processor (CPU). The computer will be much faster and more powerful when it is capable of executing more instructions every second.
                    For example, the first computer processor was the Intel 4004, which was only a 740 kHz processor and capable of processing approximately 92,000 instructions per second. Today's processors are multi-core GHz processors capable of processing over 100 billion instructions per second...
