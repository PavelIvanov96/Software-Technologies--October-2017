                        <h2>What is the Importance of Software in Daily Life?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        We live in Era of Information Technology. Software is a program which perform some specific operations. There are two types of software.
                    <ul>
                        <li>System Software</li>
                        <li>Application Software</li>
                    </ul>
                    System Software is a part of operating System which interface with the hardware for specific operation. Drivers, IDE, firmware etc. are the example of System Software.
                    Application Software is for enhancement of computing, It is based on need of users.
                    So now let’s get started with the Importance of software In our daily Life
                    Let me first ask you one question, Can you survive without Phone and Internet for one day?
                    I know answer of majority is No!
                    Even we start our day with the Application like Alarm Clock, and many check social networking sites and emails after getting off from the bed.
                    Software and Applications are developed for enhance our life. for example using E-commerce website we can save money and Time.
                    Then there are many simulators which are also one kind of software which is used to test before any physical Implementation. So software is very Important In our Life.
                    But It Depends On How We Use.
                    For example many argue that Social media is ruined our life but I’m not agree with is because social media gives us whole world as market which help every entrepreneurs to grow the business.
                    But yes it might ruined the life of those who use social media just for uploading picture of food, pets etc.rganizations embracing DevOps deploy 200x more frequently, have 24x faster recovery times, 3x lower failure rates and spend 22% less time on unplanned work and rework.
                    This is not a coincidence because these organizations have implemented a process of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI and CD) where every step of the application lifecycle from development to deployment is automated with feedback loops for continuous improvement.
