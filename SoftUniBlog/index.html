                            In our technology-driven world, it takes more than good ideas to be successful. Uber, for example, didn’t need to invent a new technology to build its business.
                            The company just took advantage of the explosion of smartphones and mobile applications to design a compelling customer experience and invent a new way of doing business.
                            But this isn’t just about Uber being able to execute a good idea. It’s also about the inability of the cab industry to act quickly to transform its own business models to compete...

                    <h2>What is the Importance of Software in Daily Life?</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    We live in Era of Information Technology. Software is a program which perform some specific operations. There are two types of software.
                    <ul>
                        <li>System Software</li>
                        <li>Application Software</li>
                    </ul>
                    System Software is a part of operating System which interface with the hardware for specific operation. Drivers, IDE, firmware etc. are the example of System Software.
                    Application Software is for enhancement of computing, It is based on need of users.
                    So now let’s get started with the Importance of software In our daily Life
                    Let me first ask you one question, Can you survive without Phone and Internet for one day?

                            <h2>What makes a computer fast and powerful?</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>
                            There are several components within a computer that help make it faster and more powerful. Below is a list of the main hardware components that help contribute to the performance of a computer.
                            Keep in mind that even the software running on the computer may impact the speed of a computer.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Processor (CPU)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            The overall speed or clock speed of the computer and how fast it is capable of processing data is managed by the computer processor (CPU). The computer will be much faster and more powerful when it is capable of executing more instructions every second.
                            For example, the first computer processor was the Intel 4004, which was only a 740 kHz processor and capable of processing approximately 92,000 instructions per second. Today's processors are multi-core GHz processors capable of processing over 100 billion instructions per second...
